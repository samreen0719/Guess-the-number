# Number Guessing Game 🎮

A simple yet engaging number guessing game built with Python. The program randomly selects a number, and the player tries to guess it with hints ("Too high" or "Too low"). Playable in the terminal.

## **Features**
✅ **Randomized Secret Number** – Generates a new number (from 1 to 100) each game.  
✅ **Hint System** – Tells if the guess is too high or too low.  
✅ **Attempt Counter** – Tracks how many guesses you took.  
✅ **Error Handling** – Prevents crashes if non-integer inputs are given.

## **How to Play**
1. **Run the game** in a Python environment.
2. **Guess a number** between 1 and 100.
3. **Get hints** – The game tells you if your guess is too high or low.
4. **Win** when you guess the correct number in the fewest attempts!

## **Code Structure**
- **Built using:**
  - `random` module (for generating the secret number)
  - `while` loop (keeps asking for guesses until correct)
  - `if-elif-else` conditions (checks guess accuracy)
  - `try-except` (handles invalid inputs)
